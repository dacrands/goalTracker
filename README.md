# goalTracker
A program that tracks goals in an Excel spreadsheet

## Tracking goals

This is a good thing, or at least so I'm told (I do have a degree in psych after all). Time is tracked in minutes.

Uncomment the first block of code to create the workbook.

## Improvements

There are quite a few UI improvements I need to make, primarily allowing the user to enter times for each goal, i.e., as it stands now you can only enter one goal per compilation.
